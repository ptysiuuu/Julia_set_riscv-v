# Julia Set Generator in RISC-V Assembly

## Description
This project implements a Julia set generator in RISC-V Assembly, outputting the resulting image in the BMP format. The program is optimized for the RISC-V architecture, aiming to efficiently compute and visualize the Julia set. The code fully leverages the capabilities of the RISC-V architecture for optimal performance.

## Features
- Generates Julia sets with customizable parameters.
- Outputs the resulting image in BMP format.
- Optimized for the RISC-V architecture.

## Technologies
- Assembly (RISC-V)
- BMP Format
